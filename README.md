# Gren's Text RPG Engine (GTRPGE)

GTRPGE is an engine for RPG games similar to a variety of such found online. This project contains both an assembler for creating game files as well as an ncurses-based interpreter for running said files.

As GTRPGE is still incomplete, no actual released are available. The assembler (build) should compile under most C++ compilers. The interpreter (play) is slightly less portable as it requires not only ncurses, but also a [GLK](http://eblong.com/zarf/glk/) library.
